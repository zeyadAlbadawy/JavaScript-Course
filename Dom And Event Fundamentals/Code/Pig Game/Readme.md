## Introduction

The Pig Game is a simple turn-based dice game where players take turns to roll a die and accumulate points. The goal is to be the first player to reach a predetermined score.

## Rules

1. **Rolling the Die**: On a player's turn, they roll a die.
2. **Adding Points**: If the player rolls a 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, those points are added to the player's turn total.
3. **Rolling a 1**: If the player rolls a 1, they score no points for the turn, and it's the next player's turn.
4. **Hold**: The player can choose to hold, which means they add their turn total to their total score and then it’s the next player’s turn.
5. **Winning the Game**: The first player to reach the target score (commonly 100) wins the game.
